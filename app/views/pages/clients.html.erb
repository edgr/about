        <p>Working as a freelance consultant for Abaca Villas, my role is to upgrade the marketing tools &amp; processes of the property in order to boost its occupancy. My scope of action is large from doing an Audit of the online presence, recruiting a new reservation staff, setting up working tools (GSuite) as well as a PMS (Little Hotelier) and a Channel Mananger (Site Minder), training the new staff, etc.
        </p>
        <p>I also performed a "mystery client" stay in order to assess the quality of the property and the services provided by the in-house team. This led to identifying minor maintenance issues but more concerning service issues to be addressed.
