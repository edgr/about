        Unlike the years before living in Asia, I now try to have a more balanced way of life between my personal & professional lifes (#workaholic). Even if this requires some sort of personal reboot, it's probably the best decision I have made recently.

        As much as possible, I try to have a limited impact on my environment, I almost exclusively use my bicycle ðŸš² to commute and always consider taking the train ðŸš„ before the plane. I also prefer to buy second-hand clothing/furniture and try to fix things before buying new ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regards to food & diet, I am lucky enough to have bio supermarkets ðŸ¥¦ surrounding me. However, no plans to become vegetarian but I am reducing the amount of meat I eat.
      </p>

        I also try to cautiously control my life online as I dislike the idea of being permanently tracked and data-processed. I now use <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> as my main browser and <a href="https://www.qwant.com/">Qwant</a> as my main search engine.
