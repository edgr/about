          Currently improving my abilities in programming with Ruby on Rails. I consider myself as a junior developer as I have more learning (and practice) to do.

          As my last experience proves it, I was able to create a business unit representing <strong> 25% of the business after 2 years</strong> and lead the team who helped me achieve this great result. I am proud to say I have learned a lot about myself during those 2 years. Especially, I have learned to work and focus my attention and energy on growing the activity; nothing else counted.

          Here are two quotes proving themselves to be especially useful and right during this mission:
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
          <blockquote class="blockquote">“On ne fait pas d'omelette sans casser des oeufs”</blockquote>
          <footer class="blockquote-footer">Unknown (if you know, let me know!).</footer>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
          <blockquote class="blockquote">“Un tien vaut mieux que deux tu l'auras”</blockquote>
          <footer class="blockquote-footer">One of the many sayings from my previous business partner.</footer>

          During my years at Villa Finder, I think I have developed the ability to identify my team member’s strengths to empower them in their position. This resulted in having them produce a lot more than they originally thought they could produce. Beyond this, I have given them confidence in themselves, consequently increasing their sense of responsibility turning into a much faster decision process. Finally, I have taught them to report to me as one of my favorites quote says:
        </p>
        <div class="quote">
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            “Rendre des comptes c'est se rendre compte”

            Unknown (same as above).
