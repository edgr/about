          During the last 2 years at Villa-Finder, I launched a business unit representing <strong> 25% of the business after 2 years</strong> and lead the team who helped me achieve this great result. I have learned to focus my attention and energy on growing the activity to reach this great result. Here are two quotes proving themselves to be especially useful and relevant during this mission:
        </p>
        <div class="quote">
          <blockquote class="blockquote">“On ne fait pas d'omelette sans casser des oeufs”</blockquote>
          <footer class="blockquote-footer">Unknown (if you know, let me know!).</footer>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
          <blockquote class="blockquote">“Un tien vaut mieux que deux tu l'auras”</blockquote>
          <footer class="blockquote-footer">One of the many sayings from my previous business partner.</footer>

          During my years at Villa-Finder, I have developed the ability to identify my coworkers strengths and empower them. This resulted in making them a lot more productive as I was able to give them confidence, consequently increasing their sense of responsibility turning into a much faster decision process. Finally, I have taught them the importance of reporting as one of my favorites business quote (in French) says:
        </p>
        <div class="quote">
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            “Rendre des comptes c'est se rendre compte”

            Unknown (same as above).
