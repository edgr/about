        Moving back to Europe and to Barcelona gave me the opportunity to reshape my lifestyle. I had the bad habit of overworking in Asia and now try to have a more balanced way of life, giving a lot more space to my <a href="/hobbies">hobbies</a> than in the past few years.

        As I am very concerned of my impact on the environment, it shapes my way of consuming. I almost exclusively use my bicycle ðŸš² to commute and always consider taking the train ðŸš„ before the plane. I also prefer to buy second-hand clothing/furniture and try to fix things before buying new ones. Food-wise, I do not deprive myself but am reducing my meat consumption.
